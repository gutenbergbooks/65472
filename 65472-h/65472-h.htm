TRUCE with Politics, I
beseech you, Gentlemen.——I
gad! ’tis unconscionable
to lecture a Man
thus at his own House.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span><i>Broadbottom</i>. By no means, Mr. <i>Overall</i>;
I look upon the Freedom with which my
worthy Neighbours here treat me, as an
Instance of their Friendship and Regard.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Roseband</i>. There spoke the Christian and
Man of sound Understanding——</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Pshaw! P—x! What have we
Fox-hunters to do with sound Understandings?——Give
me a sound Bottom, Parson,
and you are welcome to keep your Christianity
and sound Understanding for your
next <i>Christmas</i> Conversation. Ha, ha!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. Right, Mr. <i>Overall</i>; I say a sound
Bottom too.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Come, Gentlemen, let the Toast
go round.——To all sound Bottoms—No
Affront, I hope, to any one here.——What
say’st thou, honest <i>Blunt</i>?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. I say, the Vicar need not make
those d——d wry Faces at Toasting the best
Thing in Nature.——You have been paying
Homage for twenty Years to a <i>Broadbottom</i>,
and now winch at the naming a <i>Sound</i> one.——Ah!
Mr. <i>Roseband</i>; the <i>Jesuit</i> sticks
to the Cloth in <i>England</i> as at <i>Rome</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Smoothwell</i>. Why so, Mr. <i>Blunt</i>? The
Words <i>Sound Bottom</i> convey an Idea which
Mr. <i>Roseband</i> might wish not to conceive.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. And pray, good Mr. <i>Smoothwell</i>,
what is there of indecent or unseemly in the
Idea conceived at the mention of those two
harmless Words, <i>Sound</i> and <i>Bottom</i>?</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span><i>Over</i>. Wou’d a reverend Divine wish to
be put in Mind of the Days of his Youth?
Ha, ha!—— Mr. <i>Blunt</i>, had you been bred
at <i>Oxford</i>, as the Doctor was, you wou’d
have known that all are not <i>Sound</i> that grace
<i>Magdalen</i> Walks on a Summer’s Evening.
Ha, ha!</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. Mr. <i>Roseband</i>, you must not
mind the Fox-hunter; you know his Way;
he treats his Friends as freely as he wishes
they would treat him.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Rose</i>. I believe so, Sir <i>John</i>, and therefore
am in full Charity with Mr. <i>Overall</i>. But
I can’t so readily digest my Neighbour
<i>Blunt</i>’s coupling the <i>English</i> Vicar with the
<i>Romish</i> Jesuit.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. In their Politics only; as for Religion,
I leave that to the great Searcher of
Hearts.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Ah, dear <i>Blunt</i>! how many modern
Hearts will bear a Search?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. Ask Mr. <i>Broadbottom</i>; he was
last at Court.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. I was so, Mr. <i>Blunt</i>, but you
know I am but a late Comer there.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. Perhaps it had been as well for
yourself and your Country, if you had not
come there at all.—— You’ll excuse my
Bluntness, Mr. <i>Broadbottom</i>, you know I
speak freely to those I wish well.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. I know your Worth, and thank
you for your Freedom.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span><i>Blunt</i>. I hope you do, because I mean to
continue and deserve your Friendship, if
you continue your Country’s Friend at
Court.——To be plain with you, Mr. <i>Broadbottom</i>,
I am not altogether reconciled to
the critical <i>Time</i> and <i>Manner</i> of your going
to Court. ’tis an infectious Air, against
which <i>Abstinence</i> alone is the Specific.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. ’Sflesh! <i>Blunt</i>, you don’t expect
your late worthy Member, who so often
cram’d your Brother Aldermen and yourself
with Ham and Chicken, would keep Lent
at Court?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. Let him but abstain from entering
into any Covenants, and he may swill
as much as he will of his Majesty’s Old-Hock.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. Covenants! What Covenants do
you suppose, should be expected from me?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. The direct contrary of those you
entered into with our Corporation at your
last Election.——Perhaps, you forget them.——Shall
I refresh your Memory?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. You need not. I am come down to
make you fresh Assurances of serving my
Country to the utmost of my Power.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. I know you are come down to be
re-elected; and that this Company have
been invited here to-day, to receive your
Excuses for your late Acceptance of an Employment.—</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span><i>Smooth</i>. Mr. <i>Blunt</i>, your Corporation
could not expect that their Representative
would never accept of a Place under the
Crown; therefore what Excuses has the
Gentleman to make?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. More, I fear, than you can make
for him with all your Quirks of Law.
If he accepted of a Post without any Salvo,
and forgets that he has a Post whenever he is
to vote in Parliament, I will then say that
he needs not make Excuses for going to
Court.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. Ay, Mr. <i>Blunt</i>, provided my
worthy Neighbour, <i>Broadbottom</i>, turns not
a mere <i>Courtier</i>, by going to Court, he
shall have all our Consents to stay at Court
and rise there.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. A Man may rise in the Army and
Navy, and meritoriously; but what dirty
Work must a Man trudge thro’ to rise at
Court?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Why should a Man be obliged to
do more servile Work at Court than in the
Church, where we see the Learned and Pious
rise, and are translated every Day?——I
expect my good Friend here, Mr. <i>Roseband</i>,
to rise to a Deanery soon, now his
Patron has taken a Stride to Court.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. And shou’d Mr. <i>Broadbottom</i>
rise at Court, as I doubt not he will if he continues
there longer than the present Session
of Parliament; why might not my reverend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Neighbour here, rise from the Deanery to
a Mitre?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. Sir <i>John</i>, you have been always my
Friend; so have you Mr. <i>Blunt</i>. Gentlemen,
you are all of you my Friends, and as such—have
a Right to examine my late Conduct.
I have accepted of a Place, ’tis true, without
consulting you; but hope in so doing,
not to have forfeited the good Opinion
which I flatter myself you always entertain’d
of me.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. Since we are, and you think
us your Friends, ’tis fit we should deal with
you like Friends. To be plain with you,
Mr. <i>Broadbottom</i>, we here in the Country,
who wish well to our King and the Nation,
think ourselves justify’d in conceiving a
Jealousy of the Nature, Time and Manner
of the late or rather the present Change in
the Ministry. I will explain myself.—— ’tis
not so properly a <i>Change</i> of, as an <i>Ingraftment</i>
upon the Ministry. Supposing
the few of your Party that are brought <i>in</i>,
were to continue as honest and sincere, as
those <i>Deserters</i>, who made room for them,
were disingenuous and self-interested; what
can you do against Numbers? What Success
can poor <i>England</i> expect from the Endeavours
of so few?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. But, Sir <i>John</i>, you forget that
the Opposition grew.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Sir <i>John</i>. No, Sir, I don’t forget that
Opposition founded on virtuous Principles
will always grow. But what <i>Opposition</i>
can you expect to grow in a Court? You
late Comers there are but the Tail of the
Administration. Can you direct the Head
and Body? Must it not move as they direct,
or be lopt off? What will Opposition in
Council avail, where the Majority will be
so great against you? And as for Opposition
in P——t, there will be none, there
can be none. The late <i>Deserters</i>, who are
now flung out, should they grumble and
oppose, no Creature living will adhere to
them that has a Drachm of either Sense or
Virtue. And by the present Scheme, you
who were late Leaders of Opposition, are
taken off, and consequently all Opposition
ceases. I wish I may be mistaken; but,
methinks, I see a Scheme, and the artfullest
and deepest that ever was laid in this
Nation, now put in Execution.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. How, Sir <i>John</i>! a Scheme deeper
than the <i>Excise</i>?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. Or last Year’s <i>Invasion</i>, which
produced such Chearfulness in granting more
Millions than ever were granted in any one
Session before?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Rose</i>. Or the late Sir <i>R——t</i>’s Scheme
for securing his own Retreat?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. Retreat! Do you think it a Retreat
for a Man to quit the Stage to go behind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>the Curtain, where he sets all the Puppets
in Motion?</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. He does so; and this is not
the least Adroit of his Motions. All the
present Ministry, the late small <i>Engraftment</i>
excepted, are his known Creatures.
They were most of them of his own bringing
up, and of course act by his Directions.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. But, Sir <i>John</i>, how shall we be
affected by his Motions? I hope you don’t
suppose he will be able to influence us
New comers, as you call us, however he
may direct his Pupils.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. I hope he won’t; but I’ll answer
for it, he does not now matter whether
he can or no. He has lull’d you into a
Stupor, and having unperceptibly depriv’d
you of your Sting, you are no longer the
terrible Men you appeared to the Court
some time ago.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. They are now become the <i>Drones</i>
of the Hive; ha, ha!</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. They are really no better. Pardon
me, Mr. <i>Broadbottom</i>, if I think the
Epithet fits all you who are brought in to
countenance Measures the Nation disapproves
of——</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. To colour an ignominious Peace,
which is thought to be on the Anvil, because
the late Conduct of our Superiors renders
a Peace of any kind absolutely necessary.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span><i>Over</i>. And to be kick’d out again as soon
as those dirty Ends are answered, which
they were introduc’d to promote: Gad,
Brother Foxhunter, I should not care to be
<i>rump’d</i> after I had said <i>yea</i> and <i>nay</i> as directed.
You see what End the late Patriot
<i>Pretenders</i> are come to. —— Z—ns Man!
fall not, like those Coxcombs, ’tween two
Stools.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. There lies the Depth of the
present Scheme, which is but the second
Part of the late. The late <i>Deserters</i>, as
they are justly call’d, saw not that they
were digging Pits for themselves, while they
were bargaining to drop their Party for
Places at Court. What better, Mr <i>Broadbottom</i>,
have you been lately doing for yourself?
If you answer the <i>Purpose</i> of your
being taken into the Ministry, supposing it
disagreeable to the Nation, you are irrecoverably
lost in the Opinion of all who
esteem’d you before; and of consequence
will be no better than a Drone all your
Life long.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. Pray, Sir <i>John</i>, why will you
suppose the <i>Purpose</i> of the Ministry to be
disagreeable to the Nation?</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. Because I have known in my
Time but very few, if any Ministerial
<i>Purposes</i> that deserv’d public Approbation.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. You would not have us be against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>the Continuance of the War, till an honourable
Peace can be obtain’d?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Smooth</i>. Nor against the Support of the
War while it continues.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Rose</i>. Nor against such a Peace, as the
Success of the War may intitle us to.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. So! the Lessons are already put
by Heart.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Why not? you forget how apt
Lawyers and Divines are to learn. Ha, ha!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. And Patriots too, when once they
creep within the Palace Gates.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. Mr. <i>Blunt</i>, I am well acquainted
with the Uprightness of your Heart.
You love me, and therefore fear I am to
be deluded from my Duty to my Country
by the Allurements of a Post. But let me
intreat my Friends to suppress their Fears
till the End of the Session.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. I should not wonder by the End of
the present Session, or at least before the Beginning
of the next, to see you and your Brethren
reduced to your primitive Nakedness.
Of what Use can you be, after you grant
all the Court wants, and reject or throw
cold Water on every Motion for the Benefit
of the Nation?</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. Motion for the Benefit of the
Nation, said you! Who will make such a
Motion? Or if made, who will support it?
Neighbour <i>Blunt</i>, I don’t wonder that
you, who never sat in Parliament, should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>mistake the Nature of <i>Motions</i> made there;
but I, who represented your Borough in
my younger Days, am able from my Experience
to inform you, that no important
<i>Motion</i> of public Benefit will be made this
Session; or, if fortuitously made, will be
seconded. The different Parties in the
House, and Parties with different Views
there always were and will be, are led by a
<i>few</i>, who may be said to direct all the
Operations of the Session. Among that <i>few</i>,
there is generally some one or two who are
permitted to take the Lead in all Deliberations,
and from thence may be said to
direct the whole. Supposing then that the
Court should find means to take off not
only that <i>one</i>, or those <i>two</i> or <i>three</i>, but
all the Chiefs or Directors of an Opposition
at the Beginning of a Session, how can it
be expected that any Motions of Moment
will be made? or, as I said before, if made
will be seconded? All Motions to be made,
that are of consequence, are first projected
by the Leaders, and communicated and recommended
at their private Meetings and
Clubs. But strip the Party of such Leaders,
before they have Time to make, or
even resolve on a new Choice of Chiefs, and
there is an End of all such necessary and
usual Communications and Recommendations,
and probably of the very Meetings
antecedent to them. In time, a new Set
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>of Leaders may arise, but there must be
Proof of their Truth and Abilities before
they can acquire the necessary Confidence;
and such Proof is not produced hastily.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Right, old Sportsman. It must
be <i>Truth</i> and <i>Time</i> that acquire the Captains
of Foxhounds the Confidence of the
Pack.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Smooth</i>. Mr. <i>Overall</i>, you might have
spared your Comparison of Foxhounds and
Members of Parliament.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Rose</i>. Nor is Sir <i>John</i>’s Doctrine of <i>Motions</i>
less seasonable or pertinent.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. Decent Mr. <i>Smoothwell</i>, and you
cautious Mr. <i>Roseband</i>, when are apt Comparisons
to be made or necessary, and seasonable
Truths to be spoken, unless it be
on such an Occasion, and at such a Time
as the present?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. See how these Law-and-Gospel-Mongers
would debar a Freeborn from the
Privilege of expostulating with the Man to
whom he is going to delegate his Life,
Liberty and Fortune!—— Z—ds, <i>Broadbottom</i>,
sure you are not already become so
rank a Courtier, as to have retained the
Vicar of your Parish, and the Steward of
your Manors, to padlock the friendly Lips
of your plain and upright Neighbours?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. Far be it from me to endeavour
preventing the Expostulations of my Friends.
I have always asked the Opinion of my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Constituents in all Matters of Moment,
since I have been in Parliament, and hope
they will admit that I have not misused
the Trust committed to me.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. Sir, we believ’d you a true
<i>Englishman</i>; at least, let me speak for myself,
I did so, or I had not given you so
often my Vote and Interest to represent
your Country in Parliament: And I confess,
that by all that appears, you have
honourably discharged the Trust reposed in
you. But, Sir, the good Opinion I have
had of you, and even that which I entertain
of you at present, are no such Securities
for your future Conduct, considering
the present State of Affairs, as should efface
all Traces of Doubt and Jealousy out of
my Mind. You are a Man, and as such,
are not exempt from <i>Selfishness</i>, a Passion
which Ministers never fail to sooth and
gratify. I may believe you mean well;
but can’t help dreading your suffering
yourself to be <i>sweeten’d</i> from your good
Intentions.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. Sir <i>John</i>, your Concern for my
future Conduct speaks the Sincerity of your
Friendship, and I am therefore the more oblig’d
to you. But methinks the known
Probity and Honour of those Men we join
in the Administration might lay your
Doubts and Jealousies concerning my Behaviour
for the Time to come.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Sir <i>John</i>. I have nothing to do with the
private <i>Probity</i> and <i>Honour</i> of any Gentleman;
but, Sir, if you expect I should
think as favourably of those that have lately
invited you to associate with them, as
you seem to do, you are grossly mistaken.
You differ in Opinion concerning those
Gentlemen, whom you now seem to applaud,
not only with me, but with yourself.
What have those <i>most deserving Men</i> done of
late to acquire your good Opinion? It was but
just before you went up to the first Meeting
of the present Session, that you heartily
joined Mr. <i>Blunt</i> and myself, in condemning
the <i>Passiveness</i> of all those whom you
now associate with and praise. What have
they done for the Public since, or ever before,
that should endear them to you or
any true <i>Englishman</i>? Was Sir <i>R—— W——</i>’s
whole Administration obnoxious to the Majority
of the Nation? was it injurious to
all? did not those you now are <i>grafted</i>
upon, concur with him in all his Measures?
were they not most of them, the Creatures
of his Power? were not the chief of
them his Pupils, train’d up in all his Arts
and Wiles? are they not of his rearing?
are they not distinguishable at this very
Hour by his Stamp?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. By this Scheme of <i>Ingraftment</i> it
plainly appears, that if they don’t wear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>his Livery in View, they wear it under their
upper Garments.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. So that Sir <i>Brass</i>, like his Employer,
still has his cloven Foot in all our
Affairs.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. As sure as this new-devised <i>Ingraftment</i>
will ruin all our <i>Affairs</i>, unless
the <i>Projector</i> and his <i>Disciples</i> will be so
humble as to submit to be led by the Few
they have called in to help steer the Bark
in a Storm.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. And what was it but their own
servile <i>Passiveness</i> that had occasion’d the
<i>Storm</i> which they now endeavour to quell
by the Help of Mr. <i>Broadbottom</i> and his Brethren
in the late Opposition? What could
the late fallen <i>Minister</i>, of whom they
affect to complain as the Author of all our
Calamities; what could that <i>Phaeton</i>, I say,
have done, had he not been supported by
those who now affect to quit rather than
draw with him? Had not they the Power
of the <i>Purse</i>? had not they in that and every
other Respect, the Means of tying up that
<i>Adventurer</i>’s Hands from hurting his Country,
if they would? Yes, Mr. <i>Broadbottom</i>,
those Men you now venerate so much, had
the <i>Power</i>, but they wanted the <i>Will</i>. And
what was it but that fundamental, primary
Ingredient in the Composition of some Men,
<i>Selfishness</i>, which induced those Men to
misuse the Power they then had?</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span><i>Rose</i>. By your Leave, Sir <i>John</i>, tho’ the
late Minister, the <i>Phaeton</i>, as you call him,
may have misused his Power; I don’t see
why these Gentlemen who <i>remain</i> in the
Administration should be involved in his
Guilt.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Smoke the Parson, Gentlemen;
mind how cautiously he treads on <i>Jack’s</i>
Heels.——<i>May have misused his Power!</i>
How gently he touches the Sore! Then
again, the charitable <i>Man can’t see the least
Speck of Gall</i> in the <i>Doves</i> that have thrust
<i>Jack</i> from the <i>Barn Door</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. Ah! Mr. <i>Overall</i>, that <i>Barn</i> has
made many an honest Man otherwise.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. I don’t think it so, Mr. Mayor;
a Man truly Honest is no more to be corrupted
than a Woman truly Chast. But as it
is she only who is a Whore in her Heart
that can be defiled, so is it he only who is
a Rogue in his Heart, that can be warped
from his Integrity.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Gad, Sir <i>John</i>, I should be glad
to know where your <i>truly Honest</i> Men and
<i>truly Chast</i> Ladies grow. For in my poor
Observation, I knew but one Man and one
Woman that truly deserved the Epithet.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Smooth</i>. Your Mother was the precious
Exception of one Sex.——Ha, ha!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Rose</i>. And his pious <i>Dad</i> the other.——Ha,
ha!</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span><i>Over</i>. Neither; among the Men, <i>Jack</i>
the late M—r was the Exception, because
he was the only Minister that ever I heard
or read of, who had the <i>Honesty</i> to pretend
to <i>none</i>. And among the Fair, Madame
<i>V—te</i>, who held out till her H—d commanded
her and conducted her himself to
the Arms of her Lover.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Omnes</i>. Ha, ha!</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. I say nothing of the Aptness of
your Exception among the Fair; but really,
Mr. <i>Overall</i>, you have hit it off in regard
to the other Sex. The late M—r
was a Prodigy in his Way. I won’t say that
I ever knew a less virtuous Minister, but I
will, that I never knew one made less
Pretensions to Virtue.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. He courted Virtue as he did Applause.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. And was he not the Honester,
for not pretending to that he resolved not to
practise, and for not courting that which
he knew he did not deserve? But what
better Pretensions have they, who, as my
Friend Mr. <i>Overall</i> terms it, thrust him
from the <i>Barn Door</i>, to either Virtue or
Applause? Did they not give a Sanction
to all his Measures? Were not they Partners
of his Guilt? And more, were they
not the Partners of his Predecessor’s Guilt?
Had the late Minister shewn less Contempt
for them; had he wore more the Appearance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>of Modesty, or had more Deference for
their Opinions; had he seem’d to draw with
them; had he not ingross’d solely to himself
the <i>Distribution</i> of the Court <i>Manna</i>: Had
he, in short, shared with his Fellow Ministers
the vast Emoluments arising from
the Distribution of the <i>Secret-Service</i> Money,
I fancy we should never have heard
of the present unnatural <i>Ingraftment</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. Since you will have it an <i>Ingraftment</i>
rather than a <i>Coalition</i>, it shall be so;
but why should it be an unnatural <i>Ingraftment</i>?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Why indeed? Don’t we see <i>Non-pareilles</i>
and <i>Golden Pippins</i> daily grafted
on <i>Crabs</i>, and yet thrive? Ha, ha!</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. Yes, Mr. <i>Overall</i>; because
they are all nourished by their common
Parent, the Earth; and the <i>Crab-Tree</i> is a
Channel only for the Nurture to pass thro’.
In this Case, the Earth, from whence both
Species receive Nourishment, remains pure
and uninfected; the <i>Crab</i> has no more Influence
than the <i>Pippin</i>. But can we suppose
the Parity will hold in the other Case?
The old <i>Standards</i> in the Administration
ingross the <i>Soil</i>: The <i>ingrafted Shoots</i> shall
have no more Communication with it, than
their elder Brethren shall be pleased to permit.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Rose</i>. I am sorry to see all Sir <i>John</i>’s Observations
tinctured with Uncharitableness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Why should the old <i>Standards</i>, as you call
those that remain of the late Ministry, infect
the Soil, by which I suppose the ——
is meant, any more than the <i>ingrafted Shoots</i>
or new Comers?</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. The <i>new Comers</i>, for aught I
know, wou’d be as arrant Courtiers, as
supple Fawners in time, as the old <i>Standards</i>
themselves, had they equal Opportunity. But
my Life for’t, the <i>Ingrafted</i> will be kept
at Arms Length from the Royal Ear.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. I hope not, Sir <i>John</i>; those we
join are Men of Honour; and they assure
us of going Hand in Hand with us——</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. To raise the <i>Supplies</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. And screen Delinquents.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. Will they join, think you, in
National Parsimony, in the Encouragement
of Trade and Industry, and the Discouragement
of Venality and Corruption? Will
they join in repealing those Laws which
affect <i>Freedom</i>, and in lessening the vast
Power accruing to the Crown from the
great Weight of our Debts and Taxes, by the
Distribution of civil Employments? Will
they join——</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. Yes, Sir <i>John</i>, in fleecing the Nation
to fill their own Pockets, and gratify
Mr. <i>Nameless</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. That same <i>Nameless</i> must have an
excellent <i>Digestion</i>; and sure his necessary
Woman must have golden Days of it;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>for without doubt, he who swallows so
much <i>Gold</i> must sh—t a great deal of the
Metal.—— But I forget that <i>H——</i> is the
<i>Close-stool</i>, where all the precious Excrement
centers.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. And but <i>One</i>, on this Side the
Water, has a Key to that valuable Repository.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Rose</i>. For Cleanliness of Conversation,
commend me to you both, Gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. And for doubling and time-serving,
commend me to Gownsmen.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. Gentlemen, I intreat we may
live sociably together as usual. Let us not
give Way to Spleen or Ill-nature. Mr.
<i>Roseband</i> and Mr. <i>Smoothwell</i> happen at
this Time to be in a more charitable Disposition
than the rest of the Company.
But, I assure myself, you will be all of one
Opinion, when you see perfect <i>Concord</i> in
the Administration, and that <i>Union</i> directed
to promote publick Happiness.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. Mr. <i>Broadbottom</i>, I heartily
agree with you in the Banishment of Heat
and Sarcasm from our Conversation; but
can’t help dissenting from you in the other
Point. Without giving up my Reason, I
can’t reckon upon <i>Concord</i> between two
Sets of Men, as seemingly different in their
Views and Principles as can well be imagin’d.
By all that appears hitherto, you
lately <i>Ingrafted</i>, have acted on Principles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>the most honourable, and with Views the
most disinterested that ever Men did;
whereas the <i>old Standards</i> seem to have
no Views but to <i>Self-Interest</i>, nor Principles,
but such as are repugnant to <i>Patriotism</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. <i>Patriotism!</i> Ha, ha! Poor Wanderer!
Where has she taken up her Habitation,
since she was sent adrift by those
<i>Ingrafted</i> about two Years ago upon the
old Stock?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. Patience. Mr. <i>Overall</i>, and you
shall see her perch’d on the joint Endeavours
of our mottley Ministry to save the
Nation.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. I hope you will, Mr. <i>Blunt</i>, tho’
you speak it with a Sneer.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. I heartily wish we may. But in
my Mind, the Coalition on which you
reckon so much, is as impracticable as
squaring the Circle, if you Gentlemen
newly <i>Ingrafted</i>, and <i>those</i> you are <i>Ingrafted</i>
on, <i>thought</i> as you <i>spoke</i> and <i>acted</i>,
and continue the same way of <i>thinking</i>?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Have not you seen, that the late
<i>Ingrafted</i> had two Ways of <i>thinking</i>?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. One fitted for the <i>Country</i>, the
other for the <i>Court</i>?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. Good Mr. Mayor, spare your
Friends, at least till you find them tripping.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Sir <i>John</i>. For my Part, the whole Stress
of my Argument rests on a Supposition;
that both Parties of the Administration will
adhere to their native Principles and Way
of thinking. On this Supposition then where
can be the <i>Concord</i>, where the <i>Coalition</i>?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Just where the Union would be
between Kites and Doves.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. But, my Fox-hunter, leaving
Concord and Union out of the Question,
when has it been seen, that spotless innocent
<i>Doves</i> have had the weak Complaisance
of associating with the crafty and
guilty <i>Kites</i>, on the first Offer of Friendship
and Cordiality?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. Still, my worthy Magistrate, severe
upon your old Friends?</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. Mr. <i>Broadbottom</i>, call not that
Severity, which is the Result of Friendship.
I judge of Mr. <i>Blunt</i> by myself, who,
because I esteem you, fear you may be imposed
upon in the Step you have lately taken. You
could not but see that the Court made to
you, was the Effect rather of <i>Necessity</i> than
<i>Choice</i>. You must not be the Man of Penetration
I take you for, unless you saw
that you would be an unwelcome Guest
at C—t, and an unwelcome Companion
to those who invited you thither. In
such Circumstances, I should expect that
you, and those whom you have selected among
your Party to accompany you, wou’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>insist upon such Terms for your Country,
as would endear you to your Countrymen.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. But, Sir <i>John</i>, would it become
us to insist on Terms, when none were
exacted from us?</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. It not only would become you
to insist on such Terms as would be of public
Utility, but it was absolutely necessary
you shou’d, if you would maintain your
Character and serve your Country. You
<i>New Comers</i> are but a few, if compared to
those you are ingrafted on. They may,
and probably will out-argue, or rather out-vote
you, whenever you shall presume to
oppose their Measures; and should you
persist in your Opposition, they will thrust
you from the <i>Barn</i> for your Contumacy.
Such will be the best of your Case.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Smooth</i>. Best do you call it? Pray, Sir
<i>John</i>, what do you call the Worst of their
Case?</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. To quit their own Principles,
and take up those of the old <i>Standards</i>.
In that Case they might think to mend
their own private Fortunes, but would most
certainly ruin their Country, and of course
would lose all Credit with their Countrymen.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. But is it impossible for Men of
different Principles to meet each other half
Way, and agree in such Essentials as may
promote the general Good of the Community?</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Sir <i>John</i>. He who meets an Opponent
half way, recedes from his own Principles,
and embraces in part at least, those of
his Antagonist. Now if your <i>Principles</i>
were <i>sound</i>, and those of the <i>old Standards
unsound</i>, as we must believe from your
constant Opposition for the Time past;
how can you depart from yours, without
embracing <i>unsound</i> Principles? No, Sir, I
protest against half-way Meetings between
a Majority in <i>Power</i>, and a few, who, I’m
afraid, grasp too eagerly at a Shred, or rather
Shadow of that <i>Power</i>. The <i>Magnet</i>
is with the greater Number; pray Heaven,
it attracts not the smaller to it!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. Why so desponding, Sir <i>John</i>,
you who were won’t to be the firmest Prop
of our Party Hopes?</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. To be very serious, Mr. <i>Broadbottom</i>,
I apprehend we are in a wretched
Situation; and I see but one Means, by
which we may hope to better our Condition.
But I foresee that we sha’n’t have
the Wisdom or Virtue to pursue that only
Way. Notwithstanding the Groupe of Ills
we labour under; notwithstanding our
Necks are sore gall’d with the Yoke, I fear,
should the Time of procuring ourselves Ease
ever offer, Corruption will prevail, and
<i>Avarice</i> will chuse the Continuance of our
Woe. If we would expect such a thorough
Change of Measures as the Nation seem to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>wish for and require, can we hope for it from
the present Patch-work mingling of Hands?</p>

<p class='c014'>The taking Gentlemen into the Administration,
who have distinguished themselves
by their Zeal for the Interests of their
Country, is not, I fear, designed to ease
the People, but to bring those Gentlemen
to bear a Share of the public Hatred and
Infamy, which the late M—rs have
incurr’d by the most flagitious Measures.
This must cause an irreparable Breach between
the Public and those now rever’d and
beloved Patriots; a Policy by which the
Projectors think, perhaps, they leave the
Flocks without Shepherds, and may at
Pleasure then prey upon the Folds. But
let me warn these Politicians, that it is not
always safe to leave an injur’d, oppress’d,
exasperated People without Leaders on
whose Probity they may depend. On the
other hand, let me warn our Patriots, that
as a Snare may have been laid for them, it
is their Business to take care they are not
taken in it. They have been the Hopes as
well as Darlings of their Country, and it
should be their Study at this critical Juncture
not to give Room for suspecting their Virtue.
In short, they should avoid becoming
themselves the Curse of their Country, or
countenancing those that have been so for
many Years.</p>

<p class='c014'>The War for the Sake of <i>H——</i>, has been
carried on after a Manner so dishonourable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>not to say infamous, and so expensive, that
the old <i>Standards</i>, for a Reason easily
pointed out, look upon a <i>Peace</i> to be absolutely
necessary. The Conduct of the
War will not suffer them to hope that equitable
Terms will be allow’d them; on
the other hand, they must be sensible, that
the People have a greater Regard to the
Honour of the Nation than to private Interest,
and will be against sheathing the
Sword, till the Blood of our foreign Enemies
has wash’d off the Stain fix’d on the
Glory of the Nation by her domestic Foes.
In this Dilemma they may think it the best,
indeed the only Expedient to cast the Burden
on the <i>Favourites</i> of the People. If
they accept of Peace on dishonourable
Terms, the late M—rs are acquitted; if
they reject it, any Misfortunes that may attend
the War will be intirely cast upon
them. In a Word, the Ministers have entangled
the Skein, and call upon the Patriots
to disentangle it, or share the Odium
of their Folly and Wickedness. They have
woven the <i>Gordian Knot</i>, and the Friends
of the People are to loose it.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. We shall soon see who are the
Peoples Friends.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. Can you have any Doubt concerning
them?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. Were not those <i>Deserters</i> lately
thrust from the <i>Barn</i>, the Peoples Friends
too before they were <i>ingrafted</i> on the Ministry?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>All are the Peoples Friends while
they are rising on the Shoulders of the People;
but when once they are up, away
goes the Scaffolding. Mr. <i>Broadbottom</i>, I
believe you are a Friend to the People, or
I would not support your last Election, or
your present Re-election; but if you would
convince us you are truly so, let us see
you heartily endeavouring to obtain something
for those willing People that have
drain’d their Vitals to comply with a C—t
and Ministry, and bore the Heat of the
Day. Restore us our <i>Triennial</i> Parliaments.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. Or rather our Annual Parliaments,
which was the ancient Constitution.
But, Mr. <i>Broadbottom</i>, let us have them
without <i>Purchase</i>. I understand the C—l
L—st is greatly incumber’d. I hope ’tis not
intended to clear it at the People’s Expence,
before the annual Produce of it be fairly
stated and known.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. Can you expect to know any thing
the Court has a mind you should not, while
<i>Seven’s</i> the Main?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. No more <i>Septs</i> say I; I believe I
shall never love the Number <i>Seven</i> again,
as long as live.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. <i>Seven</i> or <i>Seventy</i> would be of
little Significancy in a Country and Age less
corrupt than ours. But considering the
present Depravity, I must confess that <i>septennial</i>
Parliaments afford Ministers more
Opportunity than I would willingly allow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>them, to put in Practice the Arts of the
Cabinet.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Rose</i>. If the Depravity be so great and
general as you represent it, how shall our
Condition be better’d by a Repeal of the
<i>septennial</i> Law? The Cabinet Arts, which
you so much apprehend, may be as well
practised on the <i>triennial</i> as <i>septennial</i> Servants
of the People.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. To prevent which, let us do as
our braver, honester <i>Popish</i> Ancestors did.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Rose</i>. Ah! Mr. <i>Overall</i>! Your worthy
Father would not have been so liberal of
his Epithets to Papists.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Mr. <i>Roseband</i>, my Father loved
and rever’d Virtue wherever he found it.
And he blush’d not any more than I should,
to own that our Popish Ancestors had the
true Spirit of Patriotism, and that they left
us more valuable Blessings than we are like
to leave Posterity.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Smooth</i>. How, my Politician! Sha’n’t
we and Posterity too bask in Plenty, if we
do as you say our honester popish Ancestors
did? ha, ha!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Rose</i>. Pray, Mr. <i>Overall</i>, What are we to
do in imitation of our braver Ancestors?
ha, ha!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. To <i>curse</i> the Ambitious and Corrupt.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Rose</i>. Curse, Mr. <i>Overall</i>! Is it for
Christians to curse?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Is it for <i>Englishmen</i> to be bribed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>out of their Virtue? What are the Curses
you pronounce on <i>Ashwednesdays</i>?</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. Mr. <i>Overall</i> means, I suppose,
the Anathema solemnly denounced in
the Reign of <i>Henry</i> III. by the Archbishop
of <i>Canterbury</i>, at the Head of the Barons
and other great Men of the Nation, against
all such as should directly or indirectly oppose
the Observance of the <i>two Charters</i>,
and those who should violate, diminish, or
alter in any Manner whatever the Laws and
Constitutions of the Kingdom.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. I do, Sir <i>John</i>; and the Method
I would propose should be, that the Members
of the Legislature, not excepting the
pious Lords the B—ps, on the Expiration
of the present Parliament, would meet in
<i>Westminster</i> Abbey, and there solemnly denounce,
by the Mouth of the Archbishop,
or, if some squeamish Puritans should object
to the Surplice, by the Mouths of the
Lord C—r and Sp—r, the bitterest
Curses against all who shall offer or accept a
Bribe at a new Election, directly or indirectly.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. Or who shall accept of a Place
or Pension after he is elected, in order to
support the Measures of Evil Ministers, or
screen them.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. <i>Blunt</i>, let you and I draw up a
Form of the Anathema. I would ask the
Vicar, but that he says ’tis Antichristian, to
curse the Wicked. First then, <i>Cursed</i> be
he who offers any Bribe or Gratification to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>any Freeholder or Burgher to obtain his
Vote: <i>Cursed</i> be he who is an Instrument
to corrupt any who has a Right to give his
Vote for any Candidate to represent his
County or Borough: <i>Cursed</i> be he, who having
a Right to vote, shall be biass’d in his Voting
by any private Interest, Views, or Hopes:
<i>Cursed</i> be he who makes any unjust Returns
of Members; and may such Enemies of their
Country be <i>cursed</i> in themselves, their Wives
and Posterity, and in their Goods and Chattels;
may they themselves become the Butt
of public Scorn, Hatred and Contempt,
whilst living, and their Widows and Daughters
become common Prostitutes for Bread;
and may their Sons experience that <i>Slavery</i>,
which they would have brought upon their
Country; may their Herds and Flocks die
with the Murrain and Rot; may their
Lands become barren, and may their Memory
for ever stink in the Nostrils of all
honest Men and true <i>Britons</i>. Let all
here say, <i>Amen</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. See what it is to be a Foxhunter;
no other’s Lungs would have held out in
so long a Chase of useful Curses; ha, ha!</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. Why indeed, Mr. <i>Broadbottom</i>,
if Curses would cure the great Evil of <i>Corruption</i>,
they might be truly called <i>useful</i>.
But I am afraid the World is become too
cursed to be frighten’d by Curses from the
Commission of Evil. Therefore I would
have them restrain’d by some more coercive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Means. And as the Repeal of the <i>Septennial</i>
Act, and effectual <i>Place</i> and <i>Pensions</i>
Bills, seem to bid fairest of any Means I
can think of, for removing the Gangreen
which preys upon the Vitals of our Constitution;
I should be glad to see the P——
this very Session take them seriously into
Consideration. I hope they will, for the
good of Posterity and their own Honour.
And let me add, Mr. <i>Broadbottom</i>, that I
hope it for yours, and your new <i>Ingrafted</i>
Brethren’s Sake, who must rise or sink with
the Publick, as these Points are dropt or
vigorously pushed and obtain’d. What is
it to the People who is <i>in</i> or <i>out</i> of Place,
if they receive no Benefit by the Change?
On the Contrary, a pretended Coalition
leaves them in a worse Condition than they
were before, as it deprives them of their
present Leaders, and a colourable Pretence
for Complaint. For won’t Courtiers be apt
to call that a wanton Complaint, which has
not the Sanction of the old Chiefs of the
People?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. Sir <i>John</i>, as all who hear you, improve
by your Conversation; all who converse
with you, ought to pay a Deference
to your Opinions, which are generally well
founded. But tho’ I should admit that the
Points you contend for, would be of public
Utility; yet I believe you will admit likewise,
that there may be Seasons wherein it
would not be proper to press these Matters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>with too great Warmth. It would be ill-timing
the Embellishment or Repair of
a House, when the Chimney was on Fire.
The World at Home and Abroad is unsettled
and perplexed. We have Quarrels and
Parties——</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. We have so, and Taxes, Poverty,
and Corruption. And we have likewise
open, and who are more dangerous,
secret Enemies; at least, we have lukewarm
Friends.——This is no more than what
I dreaded, when I first heard how few of
the reputed Friends of the People were invited
to C—t. When I saw all the great
Offices of Trust continued in the old <i>Standards</i>,
I dreaded the Consequence of taking
a few of the Leaders of the People into
the subordinate Posts.——Mr. <i>Broadbottom</i>,
I am sorry to tell you, that I dreaded you
would have learnt the Court <i>Catechise</i>, when
I heard you accepted of a Place before obtaining
such Points as the People contend
for, and are of absolute Necessity. Why
should it be unseasonable to restore us to
<i>triennial</i> Parliaments, and to secure Liberty
by effectual Place and Pension Bills?
What Ferment or Combustion is here at
Home, that should prevent or deter the
Friends of our Constitution from seeking its
immediate Repair, where it has been weakened
by either Time or Art? What have
the Broils of <i>Germany</i> to do with the <i>British</i>
Constitution?</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>The World, you say, is unsettled and
perplexed abroad, and we have Quarrels
and Parties at Home. Granted; and who
are accountable for the Perplexities on the
Continent and the Parties here at Home?
Not the People, Mr. <i>Broadbottom</i>, whose
Contentment you would postpone to a more
seasonable Opportunity. I should be glad
to know the ministerial <i>Seasons</i> for doing
public Justice. We have had a long Interval
of Peace since the passing the <i>Septennial</i>
Law, yet our Ministers never
thought it <i>seasonable</i> to suffer it to be
repealed. The Ministers, Sir, I mean the
<i>B——h</i> Ministers, and not the <i>B——h</i>
Nation, have been principally and primarily
Authors of the Broils on the Continent;
and our Fewds at Home are no less
owing to them.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Smooth</i>. How, Sir <i>John</i>, will you place
the Ambition of <i>France</i>, the Perfidy of
<i>P——a</i>, and the Inaction of <i>Holland</i>, to
the Account of our Ministers?</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. I will, and with the strictest
Justice.——<i>France</i> had not dared to attempt
gratifying her Ambition, nor <i>P——</i>
to support <i>France</i>, or <i>Holland</i> to look on,
if a Foreign Interest did not biass <i>B——h</i>
Ministers from the true Interest of their
Country. To sum up all in one Word,
<i>H——</i> is accountable for all the Perplexities
on the Continent, and all our Fewds at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>Home.——But what Fewds or Quarrels can
be apprehended after so hopeful a <i>Coalition</i>
as the present? When shall <i>Britons</i> expect
Relief, unless when the <i>best Men of
all Parties</i>, according to one of our Patriot
Writers, have the Power and Direction
of public Affairs?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. We are only accountable for our
own Conduct; and as we are but a few—</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. I dread you may be biassed
by the Majority. Why should you agree
to come into the Support of a tottering
M——y before you had secured such a Share
of Power as would enable you to change
Measures obnoxious and injurious to the
People? Why would you come in without
securing a Moiety at least, of the great
Offices of Trust, such as first C—— of
the T——y, S——y of S——, and P——t
of the C——t, <i>&amp;c. &amp;c</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Faith now, Sir <i>John</i>, that would
be keeping Gentlemen to d—d hard Meat.
What, not allow Men to stoop at small
Game, that have been beating about for
many Years in vain? Pshaw! Gad! ’tis
quite ungenteel and unconscionable.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. My Quarrel is not to the
Gentlemen’s Humility, but to their Want
of Prudence. Mr. <i>Broadbottom</i>, I hope, will
pardon the Expression.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span><i>Broad</i>. With all my Heart. Sir <i>John
Probeum</i> can say nothing, because I am sure
he means not, to offend me.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. Sir, you do me but Justice; I
intend an Affront to no Man, much less to
you, whom I have always esteemed.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. And of whom you shall have
no Cause to alter your good Opinion.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. I hope not, tho’ I cannot so
readily digest your <i>Seasons</i> for redressing the
People’s Grievances.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. <i>Times</i> and <i>Seasons</i> were Cant
Words with the late <i>Deserters</i>, as soon as
the People expected they would act according
to their Professions.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Ha, ha! Courtiers act up to their
Professions! Ha, ha! What a Solecism wou’d
that be? Why Man, you forget that <i>Double</i>
and <i>John</i>, and <i>Long Bib</i>, and <i>Dismal</i>, and
the Rest of that precious deserting Gang
were become <i>Courtiers</i>, when they found
out that it was unseasonable to weaken the
Ministerial Power, and strengthen that of
the People.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. Experience, they say, is the
Mother of Wisdom; but I am sorry we <i>Englishmen</i>
are seldom instructed by that sagacious
Lady. I have lived to see the
People deluded and injured by those whom
they themselves had screw’d up into Power;
and I have seen them receiving those very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span><i>Deluders</i> a second and third Time into
their Favour.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Rose</i>. A Proof of their Lenity and Good-nature,
Sir <i>John</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. Of their Stupidity rather. I
am bound to forgive an Enemy, but know
of no Injunction human or divine, that enjoins
me to trust that Enemy a second
Time, and put the Snake in my Bosom.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. Sir <i>John</i>, you shall never have
Cause for making the Application here. If
I can’t serve with Honour, I am a free
Agent, and shall make use of the Freedom
I was born to. I will fling up my P——
the Moment I find I can’t keep it consistent
with my Duty to my Country.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. There spoke the Genius of old
<i>England</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. Like that <i>noble</i> Patriot, who flung
up not long since, that he might not share
in the Guilt and Odium of the Company
he kept.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. And that noble Patriot is heartily
with us in the present Change. I hope
you will think that his Presence should be
enough to keep us all in Countenance.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. There is not a Man alive has
a better Opinion of that great Man than
myself; but shou’d he tell me of <i>Times</i> and
<i>Seasons</i> for redressing Grievances, I should
alter my Opinion of him, and think him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>infected by the Air of the C—t. But
that Patriot <i>Englishman</i> is uncapable of so
great Baseness and Folly. He knows that
War Time is the properest for enquiring into
the Misconduct of the War; and I hope
for that Reason, he and all his Friends will
encourage an Inquiry into the Miscarriage at
<i>Carthagena</i>, and into the more dishonourable
Misconduct last Year at the <i>Hieres</i>. I
hope likewise he and you will promote a
strict Inspection into the Management of
our Land War.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. You mean the <i>H—n</i> War. I
am sure we are no otherwise concerned in
it, than to have the Honour of defraying its
Expence.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. Be our Concern what it will,
it ought to have been managed with some
Decency, if not with Vigour and Prudence.
But ever since the Commencement, it has
been carried on ingloriously for the Nation,
and scandalously for those who had the Conduct
of it. And should such wrong-headed
or corrupt Agents go unpunish’d or unexamin’d
at least, it will be setting such an
Example of national <i>Lenity</i>, as may prove
fatal in the Day of Necessity.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. National <i>Lenity</i>! Ah, Sir <i>John</i>,
you were wont to call Things by their right
Names—— What shall we call the <i>Lenity</i>
shewn to the late Arch-delinquent?</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span><i>Over</i>. The Duce! what would the Man
have; was not there a S—t C—ee
appointed?</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. Yes; and the very little which
that C—ee was pleas’d to publish concerning
that Arch-spoiler of his Country,
proves that they ought to have proceeded
further.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Dear <i>Broadbottom</i>, let us have no
C—ees at all, unless you have the <i>Will</i>
and <i>Power</i> to sift Things to the Bottom:
For it is but tantalizing a Nation to pretend
doing them Justice, and never intend any.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. ’tis encouraging public Venality
and Corruption. But C—ees are pretty
<i>Tubs</i>, too often thrown out to amuse the
People.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. What Pity ’tis to abuse the
Credulity of the best natur’d People in the
World!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Sir <i>John</i>, you may praise their
good Nature as much as you please; but,
Gad! I say they are the veriest Oafs in
Christendom. Z—ds! that a People should
be so d—n’d stupid as to delegate their
Power again and again; nay, a Power too
over their Lives and Fortunes, to Men who
had done them repeated Injuries, and of
whom they had made repeated Complaints.
They complain’d of the <i>Septennial</i> as a
grievous Imposition; yet the very next Opportunity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>chose those very Men that had so
grossly imposed upon them.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. Was it not the same in regard to
the <i>Excise-Scheme</i> and the <i>Convention</i>?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. The <i>H—r</i> Troops, and the <i>&amp;c. &amp;c</i>.
to the End of a Chapter as long as the
Book of Homilies.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. But, Gentlemen, don’t you forget
to season your Account of the People’s
<i>Folly</i> with a certain native Spice called
<i>Knavery</i>, or in other Words, <i>Self-interest</i>,
which, according to Sir <i>John</i>, is the primary
fundamental Ingredient in the Composition
of most Men? Did not these injur’d
complaining People bring their Suffrages
to Market overt, where the best Bidder
was sure to have them?</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. The Fact, I am afraid, is but
too true: And at the same Time that it
proves the Corruption of the People, it
proves likewise the Necessity of an immediate
Remedy. Had those scandalous Marts
for the Sale of <i>B—sh</i> Liberty been more
common; had they been <i>annual</i>, or even
<i>triennial</i>, the M—rs would not find their
Account in the frequent Expence; nay,
they could not support it.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. Yet necessary as the immediate
Application of this Specific is, you shall see it
postponed to more pacific <i>Times</i>, and gentler
<i>Seasons</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span><i>Smooth</i>. Mr. <i>Blunt</i>, tho’ you speak thus
in Derision, yet if you reflect with Seriousness,
the Delay of a Remedy so extraordinary
as the Repeal of the <i>Septennial</i> is, till
after the War, will not seem so unmeet to
you as it appears at present.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. Dost think the <i>Repeal</i> would abate
the Courage of our Soldiers and Seamen,
and raise that of the Enemy? Dost
think it would pall the Appetites of those
greedy <i>Germans</i>, that now and long have
done us the Honour to receive <i>Subsidies</i>
from us? Wou’d the Queen of <i>Hungary</i>
and King of <i>Sardinia</i> receive <i>English</i>
Money the less freely; or defend their own
Territories the less carefully, if <i>general Content</i>
should be spread throughout this Island,
powerful as much or more by the Union of
its Inhabitants, as by their Bravery and
Wealth? Would our good Allies the <i>Dutch</i>
be deafer to our Intreaties, or slower in their
Motions than they have been of late, should
they see the very <i>Fountain</i> of our Corruption
and Venality dry’d up by a Legislative
Spunge?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Would our A—ls and G—ls
have less Sense, Experience, Courage and
Honesty, if they were to go to <i>Market</i>
with their <i>Bank-bills</i>, but every <i>Third
Year</i>?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Smooth</i>. You forget that your favourite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>A—l was lately courted at many <i>Markets</i>
without the Aid of Bank-bills.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. No, Sir; I don’t forget that his
Merit had endeared him to the People, and
render’d him hateful to—— Mi-Mi—Mi—Ministers.—’Sflesh!
I thought I could never
keep down another <i>Word</i> which would
force itself in the room of Ministers.—— But
enough of that. No, Mr. <i>Smoothwell</i>, I
forget not that that gallant, honest Man has
not been thought of in the present Change,
tho’ his Valour, Experience, Probity, and
good Sense, can’t be called in question.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. Truly I wonder’d when I saw
not his Name among the List of C—rs of
a certain Board.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. There are certain <i>Prejudices</i>,
which, in Prudence, we were obliged to
overlook when we could not surmount
them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. I don’t at all question but
there was a <i>Prejudice</i> to you <i>all</i>; but
when you were able to conquer that which
was always supposed to be conceived against
you personally, Mr. <i>Broadbottom</i>, I should
not wonder you could surmount all Prejudice
whatever.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Pr’ythee, <i>Bottom</i>, how came it
practicable to ram one of your <i>uncommon
Size</i>, down the narrow squeamish Throat
of ——? again, another <i>Word</i> would intrude
on the Word Ministers.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span><i>Blunt</i>. I’ll tell thee; to take away from
us all our Props; to strip us of our Leaders;
in short, to leave no Speaker or Man
of known Merit behind—</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. I fear that was Part of the
Plan; and if so, we are undone, unless we
are saved by the Virtue and Steadiness of
those whom the People have confided in all
along, and rais’d at last.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. You need not fear them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. I would not willingly suspect
Men, who owe more to their Constituents,
than those they have all along opposed. On
a Supposition that these had purchas’d, no
matter how infamously, they assum’d a
Sort of Right to reimburse themselves at
the Expence of the Venders. But you <i>Patriots</i>
have no such colourable Claim for
disserving those who spontaneously chose
you their Attornies with no private Views
in the World, or any Views but such as tend
to the Good of the Community in general.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Gad, my dear <i>Broady</i>, you ought
to be doubly cursed, nay doubly d—n’d,
should you not earnestly and truly serve
those that had gratuitously vested you with
ample Power over their Persons, Lands,
Goods, Chattels, Wives and Bairns.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Rose</i>. And Hounds and Hunters; ha,
ha!</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span><i>Blunt</i>. And Tythes and Dues, my laughing
Vicar—Is the <i>Liberty</i> of a free People a
fit Subject for Laughter? Is not our All at
Stake at this critical Juncture? Should
those who have been always our reputed
Friends, <i>join</i> with those who were always
deem’d our Enemies, what shall become of
us? What shall we do?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. I’ll tell you; <i>unite</i>, and join against
both.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. I should not wonder if a general
<i>Union</i> against all secret and open Enemies
would be the Consequence of any
signal Misconduct or Defection in those lately
<i>ingrafted</i>. For after such repeated Experience
as the People have had of the
Power of C—— <i>Infection</i>, it may be expected
they would go greater Lengths than
might be agreeable to the Authors of their
Despair. ’tis dangerous to push a sensible
People too far.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Pshaw! brag not too much of
your Sensibility, I beseech you, after such
Provocations as you have had since the <i>Septennial</i>
Y——e has been upon your Necks.
Gad! they are as tame as my <i>Chesnut</i> after
a Morning’s Chase.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. They are observant of the Laws,
and I hope they will always continue so.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. ’Sbud! you wou’dn’t have us
keep Measures with <i>Renegadoes</i> and <i>Promise-breakers</i>?</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Sir <i>John</i>. No; but I am for no Measure
that exceeds legal Bounds.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Z—ds Man! you don’t think I
would advise the knocking such <i>Recreants</i>
in the Head without Judge or Jury, tho’
they would merit the worst of Deaths. No;
I would not touch a Hair of their Heads;
but d—n me if ever that Man should
have my Friendship or Vote again, who
should once break public <i>Faith</i> with me.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. Right, my worthy ’Squire—— Oh!
how solemnly have we been promis’d a Redress
of all our Grievances as soon as our
<i>Idols</i> should come into the Administration!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Rose</i>. <i>Idols</i>! Mr. Mayor.——</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. Ay, Doctor; such, and worse, if
possible, are all those useless insignificant
Men, that fawn, flatter and promise, to arrive
at the Summit of their Ambition, and
forget all they had promised as soon as their
Turn is served.—Idols! Mr. <i>Roseband</i>; yes,
Sir, I would call our Patriots so to their
Faces, and even Mr. <i>Broadbottom</i> himself,
whom I always lov’d and serv’d, should the
Redress of our Grievances be postpon’d.
Tame and gull’d as we awkward Country
Putts have been; stupid as we are thought
to be, we can feel, and even see when we
are play’d off. Let the Legerdemain be
never so dextrous, believe me, we can see
through it.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span><i>Over</i>. We don’t forget how Sir <i>Bob</i> used
to fly thro’ the Hoops, when he was press’d
hard. He wou’d shift the Pack off his
own, to cast it on <i>nobler</i> Shoulders.——The
Cheat is stale, it won’t pass now.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. It won’t indeed. We know very
well what it means to have a Thing go
thro’ glibly below, when it is settled before
hand, that it shall be stifled in its Flight.
Mr. <i>Broadbottom</i>, you know my Meaning;
and you know too what you have often
promised, if ever you should come into
Play, that you would promote the use of
<i>Tacking</i>, when nothing else would do.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Smooth</i>. I am sorry that the Head of a
considerable Corporation, should give so
great Room for suspecting his Loyalty, as
to wish for the postponing the <i>Supplies</i> in
time of War.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. I am more sorry to see a Principal
of any Corporation, a Sycophant, and
Time-server. Mr. <i>Smoothwell</i>, you may or
may not excuse my plain Dealing, as you
please. Pray Sir, why might not the <i>Redress</i>
go Hand in Hand with the <i>Supply</i>? Is
a Million the less a Million for being wrapt
up in the same Paper or Parchment with a
<i>Triennial</i>, or effectual Place and <i>Pension</i>
Bills? Might not Votes of <i>Credit</i> and Votes
of <i>Inquiry</i> be very naturally blended together?
Would it swell the public Debts, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>a secret and special C——ee were appointed
to inspect the <i>Debts</i> of the Nation?</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. And the <i>State</i> of the Nation
too, Mr. Mayor. I have always lamented
the Want of such a C——ee. It could
not fail, if well chosen, to answer every
good End proposed by a National Enquiry.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Brave, upright old Man! have you
not seen <i>Pharsalia</i>? What have we got by
the late E——y into dextrous <i>Bob</i>’s Conduct?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. A <i>Proof</i> that he ought to be shorten’d
by the——</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. And pray, how would you have
those <i>worthy Men</i> serv’d, who condescended
to let us have a Sight of that precious
<i>Half-proof</i>, and not an Inch farther?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. As they deserved——</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Mum for that——Gad! <i>Blunt</i>, I
thought you too sincere for Caution and Circumspection.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Rose</i>. As much as to say, you thought his
Worship no wiser than he shou’d be. Ha,
ha!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. As much as I should think a Time-server
to be an honest Man.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. Heed him not, Mr. <i>Overall</i>, he
would set you and I together by the Ears,
but he shan’t have his Ends. (<i>Looking on his
Watch</i>.) Bless us! how insensibly Time
passes in good Company.—Mr. <i>Broadbottom</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>at what Hour shall we meet in the
Town-Hall? the sooner the better, for fear
of Accidents.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. Of Opposition, you mean——I
have heard of no new Candidate.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. I hope there will be no Candidate
but yourself; and tho’ I believe you’ll
meet with no Opposition, expect not to be
re-elected without Bustle and Murmur.
The Freemen are not quite pleased with your
late Conduct. They think you, and some
others, have been too hasty and partial in
your Distribution of Places——</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. They quite mistake the Thing,
the <i>Distribution</i> was not of our making.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. I am sorry to hear of so shameful
an Error. Were you sensible of the
<i>Necessity</i> some Men were driven to; and of
your own <i>Usefulness</i>, and yet have no Share
in the Settlement of the main Article of
the Coalition? I wish you may not live to
repent you of your Indolence or Timidity.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. Timidity! Sir <i>John</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. Yes, in Truth. I am not
afraid to tell you, that you betrayed either
too much <i>Timidity</i>, or too strong an Appetite
for Employments, when you could
make no better a Bargain for your Party, or
obtain no absolute positive Assurances that
the <i>Redress</i> should go Hand in Hand with
the <i>Supply</i>. Are we to bleed for ever?
Are we never to taste of Cordials?</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span><i>Over</i>. Our Doctors think that <i>Bitters</i>
sit best on our English Stomachs.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. <i>Bitters</i> are of a hot Nature;
the <i>Prescribers</i> should take Care, that a
too constant use of them may not <i>inflame</i>
the Blood too much.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. They have provided beforehand a
Remedy against such an Evil.——A good
many Thousands in <i>Red</i>, will cure an Inflammation
presently.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. They may, by Amputation, if
in some of the <i>Limbs</i> only; but should
ever Poverty, Oppression, or Despair, force
the Inflammation into the <i>Body</i> and Bowels,
I doubt the Surgeons in <i>Red</i> would not find
the Cure so very easy. But I hope our
Friends, few as they are, will find some
Means of perswading their fellow Practicers
to drop their <i>Bitters</i>, and put their Patients
on a Course of <i>Alteratives</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Smooth</i>. Sir <i>John</i>, we all wish for Cordials
and Restoratives; we own they are wanting;
but I am afraid a Time of War and
Confusion is not the proper Season for administering
them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. I am much more afraid, Mr.
<i>Smoothwell</i>, that you have learnt a Language
newly imported from <i>Court</i>. <i>Confusion</i>, if
you mean here at Home, there is none;
and as for the <i>War</i>, I don’t think it wou’d
or cou’d go on more ingloriously and scandalously
than it has since the Commencement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>of it, should our State Physicians alter
their Practice.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. Scandalously as it has been conducted,
it has cost us more than the most
successful and best managed War.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Our last <i>Foraging</i> Campaign stood
us dearer than that of <i>Blenheim</i>; and shou’d
we have one or two more such parading
Summers, to pot goes the <i>Sinking Fund</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. I shudder at the Thoughts of
<i>re-mortgaging</i> that only Hope we had of
seeing one Day our Trade and Industry exonerated
from the Clogs that oppress them.
The <i>Fund</i>, which should be sacred, has been
too often made free with; but the Incroachments
upon the Purpose of it being temporary
only, it had no very bad Effect; whereas
the Case would be otherwise, should they
be perpetual.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. And because it will have that
ruinous Consequence, you’ll see violent unhallow’d
Hands laid on that darling Hopes
of our People.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Why the D——l don’t our Sages
give Lotteries of six Millions, instead of six
hundred Thousand? There are Fools enough
in <i>England</i> to fill them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. Another destructive Way of
raising the Supplies. There is no Method
more injurious to Trade than Lotteries in general;
but when managed as our late ones
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>have been, they become essentially a public
Nusance.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. You mean the <i>sharing</i> out Tickets
and Chances?</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. I do. Never was any Invention
more destructive of Industry. The poor
<i>Industrious</i>, whom it is the Policy of all Nations
to cherish and encourage, are by this
<i>sharing Traffick</i>, exposed to inevitable
Destruction. Who but the Poor will buy
an Eighth or <i>Sixteenth</i> of the Chance of a
Ticket? The Rich will deal in whole Tickets;
but ’tis the poor Industrious only that
ruin themselves to be in Luck’s Way, as they
term it. ’tis this poor but useful Class of
the People only, that game at 30 <i>per Cent</i>.
more Disadvantage than the richer Drones.
No Temptation should be thrown in the
Way of the Industrious; but on the Contrary,
all hurtful Incentives should be removed.
If you will tempt them to the
Hazard Table, let them play upon the
Square. Bring the Price of Tickets down to
their Level; and let not the Jews, Sharpers,
and Drones of the Nation be permitted to
make a Property of them. But why might
not the Sums raised the two last Years by
way of Lottery, be as well brought into the
<i>Exchequer</i> by any other Means?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. But no Means would so effectually
draw off the Attention of the Public from
our Misery and impending Danger. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>whatever some idle Folks may think, they
tell me ’tis one of the principal <i>Arcana’s</i>
of the Cabinet, to contrive artfully, that
is imperceptibly, to draw off the public
<i>Attention</i> from the Conduct of <i>Superiors</i>.
You can’t conceive how close and out of
Sight these State Spiders spin their Webs.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. But I can very well conceive
that the People have Arms long and strong
enough to reach and sweep those Webs
clear away whenever they will.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Ah! Sir <i>John</i>, where have the
People you brag so much of, hid their Brooms
and Brushes for many Years past?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. Behind the Clouds of <i>Corruption</i>
and <i>Hypocrisy</i>, where they are like to remain
much longer, or I am mistaken.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. Mr. <i>Blunt</i>, it gives me a Concern
to see you continue your Diffidence of your
best Friends. You shall find, that neither
<i>Corruption</i> nor <i>Hypocrisy</i> will stand in the
Nation’s Way to Happiness, if those whom
you deem <i>England</i>’s Friends can help it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. As Jealousy is said to spring
from Love, <i>Diffidence</i> may be said to be
founded in Friendship. Mr. <i>Blunt</i> hopes he
has no Reason to suspect your <i>Intention</i>,
but dreads you have put it out of your
Power to serve the Public. You may have
perceived, Mr. <i>Broadbottom</i>, during the
whole Conversation, that your Friends apprehend
this <i>Coalition</i> as you call it, or <i>Ingraftment</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>as we express it, will answer no
Purpose of the People, who groan under the
pressure of heavy Taxes, a vast Debt, Decay of
Trade, the Yoke of Penal Laws, and those
worst Y——s of all, the <i>Septennial</i> and the
Corruption of their ——s. In short, they
dread your being over-reach’d by your
more experienc’d Partners, or rather your
being jostled out of the Course, by the
abler Jockeys of the C——t. If you wou’d
serve your Constituents in your present Situation,
you must act with Caution.——</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. With <i>Honesty</i>, you should say
rather. What Caution is necessary in answering
the Hopes of the People? They
desire but what is absolutely for their Safety.
They expect no more than has been often
solemnly promised them. And sure a Man
that intends to be as good as his Word need
not pick out every Step of his Way.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. The Ground about C——t, they
say, is d——d slippery.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. And for that Reason I would not
have had our Friends get upon it before they
had secured their Footing there. See what
is become of the late infamous <i>Deserters</i>
for want of such Precaution.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. Let us draw no invidious Inferences
from the Examples of a Crew
that are now as despicable as they are
odious to the whole Nation. A Crew that
can’t claim even the Merit of being intentionally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>upright. They did not so much
as attempt keeping Faith with the People.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. But they kept it religiously with
the <i>Barn</i> Keeper.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. I can’t say who was to be <i>indulged</i>
by the War, but sure I am the Weight
of it is grievously felt all over the Body politic.——Mr.
<i>Broadbottom</i>, you have been
lately at Court, pray what do they think
there of the War? Are we like to get out
of it with Honour? in short, are we like
to get out of it at all?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Out of it at all!——The D——l,
you would not have us serve an Apprenticeship
to the War, as we do to our
P——ts?</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. If it be no better manag’d than
it has been hitherto, I don’t see why this
War might not last much longer than seven
Years.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. I’ll tell you why it can’t, because
we shan’t be able to maintain it so long. By
mortgaging the <i>Sinking Fund</i> we may hold
out three or four Years pretty tolerably;
but after that, souse we go to <i>Mint</i> or
<i>State-bills</i> at 50 <i>per Cent</i>. Discount, as in
France in old <i>Lewis</i> XIV. his Days.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Rose</i>. Gentlemen, however, will consider,
that we can’t get out of the War as
easily as out of an Assembly Room in the
Times of our Horse Races.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Sir <i>John</i>. I am sure it would be towering
Madness to continue it on the same
Footing it has been carried on hitherto.
The <i>Dutch</i> should come in for a full equal
Proportion of the Expence, or I would not
have a Red-coat left in <i>Flanders</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. Let the Cheesemongers look to
their Barrier and be d——n’d, if they don’t
come down Guinea for Guinea, and Shilling
for Shilling with us towards preserving it.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. <i>Blunt</i>, if you would curse the
<i>Dutch</i> effectually, you must wish them
undamm’d.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. Damn’d or undamm’d let ’em be,
before Old <i>England</i> wades out of her
Depths to hold them up by the Chin.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. Let us hope for the best. They
may hear Reason, they may see their Interest
when painted by so masterly a Hand as
is now intrusted with the Pencil.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. If Wit, Eloquence, Politeness,
Frankness and Integrity, could move a
<i>Dutchman</i>, I should not doubt of that great
Man’s Success; but as nothing but <i>Self-interest</i>
can engage either his Heart or Attention,
I fear his L——p won’t be able to persuade
that <i>selfish</i> People to think it for their Interest
to declare War against <i>France</i> and <i>Spain</i>
at the critical Time that we are at Variance
with those Crowns. We are to consider
this Juncture as the Harvest Season of the
<i>Dutch</i>. All the Markets we are shut out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>from by the War, are open to them by a
Neutrality. But what I believe weighs
not a little with them, is, that they dread
embarking with us ever since they perceived
that the Views of our Statesmen have
tended more towards <i>H——r</i> than <i>England</i>.
’Tis that observable Bias to a <i>Foreign
Interest</i> that will deter the <i>States-General</i>,
if my Lord <i>C——</i> does not succeed
in his Embassy.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Broad</i>. Perhaps they may conceive better
Hopes from the new Administration.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir <i>John</i>. Perhaps they might, had the
Administration been <i>new</i>. But as it is no
more than an old Garment patch’d with
new Cloth, I fear the <i>Dutch</i> will hardly
alter their Plan on any Assurances such a
motley M——y can give them. They
may think, and perhaps too truly, that the
same Measures will be follow’d, the same
<i>Interest</i> be pursued, since the Majority, and
the chief in Office of the A——n, are of
the old Stamp. And they as truly may
think, that neither Harmony nor Success
can attend Counsels jarring between two
different separate <i>Interests</i>. While the Interest
of <i>H——r</i> clashes with that of <i>England</i>,
we must neither expect Harmony with
the <i>Dutch</i>, nor Success in our Wars.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Nor in any thing else, I think.
Would to God we could join that precious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span><i>Manor</i> to the <i>Orcades</i>, or send it adrift to
<i>Lapland</i> or the <i>North Cape</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Blunt</i>. Since we can do neither, would to
God our Statesmen would shew themselves
to be <i>Englishmen</i>!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Over</i>. Since we are got in the praying
Strain, let us all pray that our <i>new</i> M——y,
or at least those lately <i>ingrafted</i> upon the
<i>old</i>, may not become as arrant <i>H——ns</i> as
their grafted Predecessors, the late <i>Deserters</i>.
Let us all say, <i>Amen</i>.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
